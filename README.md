Oorula Soru - Food Delivery Application
Dec 2021 - Jan 2022

This Project named ‘Oorula Soru’ is a food delivery application. 
It enables users to order food online using this application from various restaurants that would partner up with our company and get their food to their residence. 
The application would use MySQL as backend software to store the database and would use Python to form the basic user interface. The intent of this initiative is to support local businesses and uphold the vernacular culture of the residents.
